## Warm-up challenge

Create a simple singly linked list with six nodes. 

write a method printList() that traverses the created list and prints the data of each node.

Write a method that returns a sum of all elements of the singly linked list

**Example:**
``` python
3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 1 -> 6
sum = 3 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 6 = 25 
```

**Instructions:**
- Fork (the clone) `https://github.com/golclinics/golclinics-dsa` and create a folder/directory called
`classwork`. In it, create another folder/dir called `04`. That is where we will put all our
stuff for the `04 Linked Lists` topic.
- Once you are done with the class challenges, do a PR against our base repo. It won't be merged but will be for the purpose of class review. The same will apply for your assignments.

> **Note** - if you are using languages like C# and Java, make sure, you _gitignore_ the binary folder.
