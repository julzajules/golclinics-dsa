## Warm-up challenge

### Word Frequency

Write a method/function, `wordFrequecy(S)` that takes a sentence, `A` \
and the count of the word appearing the highest number of times.

**Examples:**

```python
"Life is so so good" -> 2 # `so` appears 2 times
"All coders are introverts, George is a coder, therefore George is an introvert" -> 2 # `George` and `is` appear 2 times
"life is good" -> 1 # All the words are appering once
"" -> 0 # No single word
```

**Instructions:**
- Fork (the clone) `https://github.com/golclinics/golclinics-dsa` and create a folder/directory called
`classwork`. In it, create another folder/dir called `05`. That is where we will put all our
stuff for the `04 Dictionaries and Hashmaps` topic.
- Once you are done with the class challenges, do a PR against our base repo. It won't be merged but will be for the purpose of class review. The same will apply for your assignments.

> **Note** - if you are using languages like C# and Java, make sure, you _gitignore_ the binary folder.
