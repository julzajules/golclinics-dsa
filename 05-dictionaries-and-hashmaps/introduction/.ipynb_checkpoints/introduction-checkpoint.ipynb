    "# Introduction to Symbol Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- A symbol table is a key-value store. It associates a particular key with a particular value\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples\n",
    "- Phonebook\n",
    "- English word dictionary\n",
    "- Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Operations\n",
    "- `void put(key, value)`:   Associate a value with a key\n",
    "- `Value get(key)`: Retrieve a value associated with the provided key\n",
    "- `void remove(key)`: Remove the key and its associated value\n",
    "- `bool contains(key)`: Check if there's a value associated with the provided key\n",
    "- `int size()`: Number of key-value pairs\n",
    "- `Iterable<Key> keys()`:  Return all keys in the symbol table\n",
    "- `Iterable<Entry> entries()`: Return all entries(key-value pairs) in the symbol table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Different types of Symbol Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different programming languages have different names for symbol tables\n",
    "- Some programming languages name the symbol tables based on how they are implemented (Storage mechanisms backing the implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Properties of a good `key`\n",
    "- Immutable\n",
    "- Hashable\n",
    "- Comparable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparable keys allow us to do the following additional operations on symbol tables:\n",
    "- `Key min()` - Get the minimum key\n",
    "- `Key max()` - Get the maximum key\n",
    "- `int rank(key)` - Number of keys less than the provided key\n",
    "- `Key select(int k)` - kth smallest key in the symbol table\n",
    "- `Key floor(key)` - The largest key `<=` to `key`\n",
    "- `Key ceiling(key)` - The smallest key `>=` to `key`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elementary implementations\n",
    "- LinkedList\n",
    "-- Very in-efficient `get` operation\n",
    "- Array\n",
    "-- Two arrays, one for keys, and the other for values\n",
    "-- Keep the `keys` array sorted to allow binary search on keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficient implementations\n",
    "- Hashtables with Array + LinkedList backing\n",
    "- Binary Search Trees(BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hashtables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's say we an array of size `m`\n",
    "- An array uses `numeric indices` to be able to either retrieve or store a value at a given `index`\n",
    "- You can see the `index` as the `key` and the value stored/to be store at the index as the `value`. Essentially, an array is a key-value store, with restrictions on what constitutes a `key`\n",
    "- What if we could overcome this restrictions?\n",
    "- Let's say you want to store the following pairs of values: \n",
    "   - \"Cynthia\" -> \"UoN\"\n",
    "   - \"Ken\" -> \"JKUAT\"\n",
    "   - \"Bildad\" -> \"KU\"\n",
    " \n",
    " and be able to answer questions like / or carry out the following operations:\n",
    " - What Univesity does \"Cynthia\" and \"Ken\" attend\n",
    " - Does \"Bryan\" attend any univesity?\n",
    " - How many students do we have attending university\n",
    " - Can we get all the universities attended by the student\n",
    " - Bryan has joined Strathmore Uni, can we keep store that\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ## Hashing\n",
    " - We have a function `f` that takes in a student name X and returnes to us a number within the range 0 - N where N is the size of the array:\n",
    " \n",
    " f(\"cynthia\") -> 0\n",
    " f(\"ken\") -> 1\n",
    " f(\"bildad\") -> 2\n",
    " \n",
    " Then we can use the result of apply `f` over the student name X as the index into the array.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    " - What happens if two keys hash to the same value?\n",
    " - What happens if your function `f` takes really long to produce an index\n",
    " - What if the key is an object like an array\n"
