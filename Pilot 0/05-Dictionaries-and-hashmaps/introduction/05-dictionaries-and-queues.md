## 01. Dictionaries and Hashmaps - Assignments
- Implement a hash function `hash(S)` that takes in a string `S` and computes a hash value `V` based 
on every charater in the string `S`
- Implement a hash function `hashObject` that takes in a Student object `S` with the following fields:

```
class Student:
  string name
  int age
  long marks
```

and computes a hash value `V` for the object

2. Bonus:
    - [ ] Implement a function `histogram(S)` that takes in a string `S` and plots a histogram of words in the sentence:
    ```
    # e.g Given a sentence S:   "Life is so so good", plot

    Life: *
    is:   *
    so:   **
    good: *
    ```
