## Warm-up challenge

### Mathematical expression evaluation


Write a method/function, `evaluate(S)` that takes a `simple mathematical` expression `S` and returns the result of evaluating the expression. The mathematical experssion will only 
contain `+` and `-` operators. 


**Examples:**

```python
"1 + 1" -> 2
"3 - 7" -> -4
"4 + 8 - 2" -> 10
"8 + 3 + 6 + 2 - 3" -> 16
```

**Instructions:**
- Fork (the clone) `https://github.com/golclinics/golclinics-dsa` and create a folder/directory called
`classwork`. In it, create another folder/dir called `03`. That is where we will put all our
stuff for the `03 Stacks and Queues` topic.
- Once you are done with the class challenges, do a PR against our base repo. It won't be merged but will be for the purpose of class review. The same will apply for your assignments.

> **Note** - if you are using languages like C# and Java, make sure, you _gitignore_ the binary folder.
