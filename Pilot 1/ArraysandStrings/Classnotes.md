# ARRAYS CLASS I
Array - Contigouos memory allocations (Layers and layer of bits)
Most dynamic languages double the size of the array once  you have more than the defined elements

Most strongly typed languages require you to define the size of the array first before you start using it for space efficiency because failure to do this consumes alot of space as the elements are being re-copied to create a new array

# Subscripting

# Challenge 1

 # ARRAYS CLASS II
A string is not mutable - The value of the string cannot be changed without creating a new object (string).
