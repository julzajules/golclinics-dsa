##Lesson 1

Stacks implementation using ArraysArrayLists, Link list
Dont implement a stack in which you can access/ see the most bottom item first. - How can you prevent this practically? ENCAPSULATION

Stack Operations & Complexities
Push O(1) - Can be expensive
Pop O(1) - Deletes item from stack
Peek O(1) - Seeing what's at the top of the stack
Don't lose the refernece to the item at the top
Size (size of the array), Capacity (items in the array)
For an empty stack, the top index is -1

In order to push, you start by incrementing
Capacity is always top +1

##Applications of stacks
1. Checking forf balanced parenthensis
2. Reversing a string
3. Back button on browsers
